/**
 * ตลาดวันนี้ — one row, one market.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * A BAND, NOT SIX CARDS
 * ===========================================================================
 * `.data-strip` is the product's existing shape for "one object with several
 * facets": a hairline rectangle whose cells are divided by rules rather than by
 * gaps. Six boxed cards in a row would say these are six independent things,
 * and they are not — they are six readings of one market, which is the whole
 * claim the status line underneath makes.
 *
 * Six across at every width. On a handset the strip overflows and
 * `.data-strip-scroll` scrolls it sideways; it does NOT reflow into three rows
 * of two, because a band that becomes a block stops being a band.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * THE MARK READS MEANING, NOT DIRECTION
 * ===========================================================================
 * A rising VIX is bad news even though the number went up, so each cell's mark
 * is `inputStatusLevel`, which applies the input's own polarity — the same
 * helper, from the same module, that the Market Status card uses. `OvIndexReading`
 * carries no polarity, so the polarity and the dead band are read from
 * `MARKET_STATUS_INPUTS`, which is the table `indices.ts` builds the readings
 * from in the first place. Nothing is computed here that is not a lookup.

/**
 * ONE CELL, TAPPABLE WHEN THERE IS SOMEWHERE TO GO.
 *
 * The nine cards this section replaced were each a single anchor to the
 * instrument's own page, and the strip that replaced them was nine `<div>`s —
 * a reader who tapped a price got nothing. This puts the anchor back ON THE
 * CELL rather than around a card: same class, same padding, same height, so the
 * band stays a band. The hairlines are `box-shadow` on the cell and are
 * unaffected by what element draws them.
 *
 * `href === null` renders a plain `<div>`, and that is a deliberate state, not
 * a fallback. A cell that looks tappable and opens a page with no price on it
 * is worse than one that does not invite the tap — see `MarketTodayStrip`,
 * where the six instruments have no detail page today.

        TWO READINGS, EACH SAYING WHAT IT MEASURES.

        These were one line: a status word with a coloured mark, and the regime
        beside it as bare secondary text. That put two answers to two different
        questions under one dot — and the dot belonged to the first. "🔴 ตลาด
        ไปทางลบ  กลาง ๆ" reads as a single sentence contradicting itself, when
        it is really "the six instruments point down" followed by "the three
        that price risk are not alarmed", which is a coherent and useful day.

        `StatusRow` is the product's existing shape for exactly this — a muted
        name, a middle dot, then the mark and the phrase — so naming the two
        readings costs no new component and lands them in the same alignment the
        stock page and the planner already use.

        The names are the shortest pair that still says these measure different
        things. "ทิศทาง" does not repeat the "ตลาด" its own label already
        carries, and "เงินรอบตลาด" names the subject the risk trio actually
        reads: not how risky the market is, but what the money around it is
        doing.

        `status === null` means the equity inputs were not all readable, and the
        honest answer is to say so rather than to soften the word — the numbers
        above still print whatever did arrive.
